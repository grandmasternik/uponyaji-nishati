    <h3>Build a Mask Guide</h3>
    <p> To begin your co-creation with us, we first need you to select the clay that best fits your skincare needs from the dropdown below.  <em>Recommendation: Bentonite clay a heavy, drying clay; if you intend to use this mask more than 2x per week and have dry and/or sensitive skin, we recommend choosing one of the lighter clays.</em></p>

    <div class="dropdown"></div>

    <p>Next select the oil that will best suit your skin type from the dropdown below <em>Recommendation: If you have oily or combination skin, avocado oil and coconut oil is best to be avoided. Try our lighter oils: grapeseed or hempseed.</em></p>
